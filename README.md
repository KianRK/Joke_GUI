# Joke_GUI

This is my GUI implementation of the functionality from my Print_Joke_API repo.

Since I need GUI for several projects I have in mind and wanted to get familiar with python GUI's anyways, I thought this
would be a good starting point.
I had the backend functionality already finished and only needed to adapt it to communicate with a GUI.
The GUI would not need to be very complicated, but versatile enough to get me familiar with some basic GUI functionalities. I programmed a GUI before in Java, but I mainly followed a tutorial and now I want to learn it from ground up.

There are quite a few GUI frameworks available for python. Tkinter - the meanwhile built in library, PySide6 and PyQt where the ones I found most interesting after some research. I finally decided to use PyQt, because of its many advantages like cross-plattform compatibilty, its extensive functionalities and last but not least also because I had free access to Beginning PyQt from Joshua M. Willman through my university.

So this first commit I am uploading is not the final version as I am imagining it, but a first interim result. The main functionality is already implemented and now I only need to add a little details to make it a little bit prettier.
